                <h1>Sph3re Slide</h1>
                <p>Started in June of 2024, Sph3re Slide is a WebGL game made with Unity. Sph3re Slide is a game about random generation and scoring the highest amongst the other players. This game took inspiration from two very well known games; <a href="https://snowrider3d.com/">Snow Rider 3D</a> and <a href="https://slopeonline.online/">Slope</a>. Using very limited resources, I was able to make the game in 1-2 months, taking breaks in late June, July, and late August. It was honestly so fun making this game, and I hope to continue working on it in the future. <s>(Visit <a href="">Sph3re Slide</a>)</s></p>

                <h1>Squair Sirkle</h1>
                <p>Started in August 2024, Squair Sirkle is a Github-hosted website meant to serve as a place to upload blogs and updates about my ongoing, or finished projects. I have been wanting to make one of these Dev blogs for quite some time now, so I finally found my time to make it, in August. This website is planned to be a home page for links to my projects, such as Sph3re Slide, and some other future projects. Any project of mine will have one of these links somewhere on the website.</p>

                <h1>(New) GloShooters</h1>
                <p>Started in September 2024, GloShooters is a ongoing WebGL project. The game was based off the old game "Asteroid", and a <a href="https://youtu.be/kcs0yoohxsI">Game Jam</a> entry. Overall, I spent 3-6 hours working on the game. In the game, you have to move around the map and shoot enemies, which follow you as you get close to them. The scoring system is quite buggy, most of the time it does not work but some times it works fine. Across the whole map, there is some secrets. Go find em out for yourself!
