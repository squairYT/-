                <h1>Sph3re Slide</h1>
                <p>Started in June of 2024, Sph3re Slide is a WebGL game made with Unity. Sph3re Slide is a game about random generation and scoring the highest amongst the other players. This game took inspiration from two very well known games; <a href="https://snowrider3d.com/">Snow Rider 3D</a> and <a href="https://slopeonline.online/">Slope</a>. Using very limited resources, I was able to make the game in 1-2 months, taking breaks in late June, July, and late August. It was honestly so fun making this game, and I hope to continue working on it in the future. (Visit <a href="">Sph3re Slide</a>)</p>

                <h1>Squair Sirkle</h1>
                <p>Started in August 2024, Squair Sirkle is a Github-hosted website meant to serve as a place to upload blogs and updates about my ongoing, or finished projects. I have been wanting to make one of these Dev blogs for quite some time now, so I finally found my time to make it, in August. This website is planned to be a home page for links to my projects, such as Sph3re Slide, and some other future projects. Any project of mine will have one of these links somewhere on the website.</p>
